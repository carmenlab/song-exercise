# Bohemian Rhapsody
### Queen

------- 1 --------
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide

------- 2 --------
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy


Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go

------- 7 --------
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
------- 9 --------
I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah, no we will not let you go, let him go

------- 10 --------
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
(Will not let you go) let me go (never, never let you go) let me go (never let me go)
