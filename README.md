# Bohemian Rhapsody
### Queen

------- 1 --------
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go

------- 3 --------
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me


------- 7 --------
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
------- 9 --------
I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah, no we will not let you go, let him go

------- 10 --------
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
(Will not let you go) let me go (never, never let you go) let me go (never let me go)


------- 13 --------
Oh oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows
